and you've found my stream-of-consciousness blog about roleplaying games. 

{% comment %} TODO: If you would like to write an article about your roleplaying experience, see how to contribute to the blog in <<this tutorial>> {% endcomment %}

All my coding projects are open source and for now all of them are embedded in this website. If you're interested how a particular generator works, scout its post in the [repo](https://github.com/asyncmeonov/asyncmeonov.github.io).

If you've found something inspirational, why not <script type='text/javascript' src='https://ko-fi.com/widgets/widget_2.js'></script><script type='text/javascript'>kofiwidget2.init('Buy me a coffee', '#29abe0', 'P5P43MW87');kofiwidget2.draw();</script>
