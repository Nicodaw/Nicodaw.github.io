and you've found my stream-of-consciousness blog about roleplaying games. 

{% comment %} TODO: If you would like to write an article about your roleplaying experience, see how to contribute to the blog in <<this tutorial>> {% endcomment %}

All my coding projects are open source and for now all of them are embedded in this website. If you're interested how a particular generator works, scout its post in the [repo](https://github.com/asyncmeonov/asyncmeonov.github.io).

This website is built with [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and runs the default [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme with some modifications.

I occasionally use the amazing artwork of [2-minute tabletop](https://2minutetabletop.com/) in my examples.
