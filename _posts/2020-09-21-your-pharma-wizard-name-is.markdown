### A bit of backstory...
I recently remembered about a very old post on tumblr:

{:refdef: style="text-align: center;"}
![tumblr user vague-yet-menacing writes: why do 90% of all medicines sound like cool wizard names](/assets/img/drug_image_1.png)
{:refdef}

and in a bid to tap into this previously unknown power, I decided to make a little pharma-wizard name generator. Now you can start a new campaign as _Viagra the Almighty_ !
