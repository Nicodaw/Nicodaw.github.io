_This is a thought process overview that is irrespective of your favourite edition._
## The (potential) clash of DM and Player experience
The creation of a full-fledged world from scratch is undoubtedly a very daunting task. When I was first starting my DM life (and yes, get used to DMing for life) I jumped head first into curating everything from the topology of the world, through the geopolitical relationships between countries and organisations to describing the notable dunes in _The deserts of Kohrl_. A time consuming and often tiring endeavour, but the expended time and energy don't matter, because your players will love your world... right?

Well, sometimes. Irrespective of the type of players you have, their experience gravitates around pushing the boundaries of your world. Be them really keen on deep and complicated social interactions with NPCs, enjoying twisted political intrigue and mystery or just want to have hours of on-the-edge combat, they want to experience _their_ story through _their_ characters. This is especially true for newer players and if you're a new DM, chances are that will be your party. This is what I would consider the clash between the DM and Player experience of tabletop RPGs. Or should I more accurately say: the clash of expected experience. The two of the more unpleasant scenarios that could lead to a game loosing its charm are:

1. a DM railroading his players because he _expected_ they'll want to see his own story unfold with no meaningful input from them
2. a Player _expecting_ that the DM's setting is a lawless place for achieving unsolicited dark fantasies.

To avoid these doomsday scenarios, we need to marry the party members' desires for frivolity and conquest and the DM's desire for finishing a damn game. How do we do that?

# A set of suggestions for aligning expectations
I am the kind of DM that tries to focus on player engagement and as such I acknowledge that sometimes my ideas don't fit the party. I often find myself preferring to rewrite a chapter or two after I've understood what the player focus is.

## A two-step suggestion for an engaging narrative
The main intuition behind my way of making everyone involved in the narrative is summarised in the following points:

1. Give agency to your players :: make them build a bit of the world by promoting, challenging and rewarding creative backstories that pose open-ended questions
2. Tie those loose ends in players backstories with your own original world

Allowing a player to conjure a bit of your homebrew world at character creation is effectively getting a prompt. That alone has solved many of my writer's blocks in the past. It also gives huge incentive for the player to be engaged in the world. This usually happens when I give my new players a loosely defined, but yet logical sandbox world and ask them to place their character in that world with no restrictions. What I mean by _"no restrictions"_ is that you _guide_ the players around the loosely defined sandbox and if they want to assert something radically illogical for the current setting, they must justify it by telling you a story of how its possible. This has led to some impressive worldbuilding including but not limited to Goliath tribe structures in hostile northern territories, the modus operandi of a religious-economic organisation, the deep dark desires of a now forgotten king and the rites and beliefs of several lower-deity pagan pantheons.

Your ultimate goal as a DM is to ask the players to convert the backstory to an active narrative and transform this clichÃ©:

> Kiko is an edgy kid with dead parents who seeks to wreck havoc and acquire {bit,ri}ches.

into something more engaging like:
> The crops in the Overgrowth weren't good this year and young Kiko remembers everyone in his hometown of Stolipinovo getting a bit uneasy. He did not pay much attention as his parents never allowed him to go hungry, but he did remember his home receiving regular visits by a mysterious one-eyed man with a cross tattooed on his right forearm. Carefree Kiko did not pay much attention until the morning that his mother did not wake him up...

You now have a plethora of unanswered questions to use for your story! 
* Who is the one-eyed man? 
* Where are Kiko's parents?
* What did he want from Kiko's parents? 
    * Did they strike a deal and if so what was it?
* Was there a hidden reason for the bad crop yield? 

Now _Kiko_ can grow up as is dictated by the _edgy trope_: in the slums, parentless and enjoying his vagabond lifestyle. But the moment you get fed-up and want to get him focused, you can just drop in the _one-eyed man_. And the best thing is you still have the agency to define who this character is! Woe and behold, One-eyed Jim turns out to be a human debt-collector (read that as assassin) working for the Big Mysterious Organisation and also a key NPC that you designed for your original campaign.

# Thoughts on applying this system
In my experience, this system is most effective when you apply it from the start of your campaign, but it doesn't have to be. Giving players agency as the game progresses is also important if you are to maintain that engagement. But how do you give players narrative control if they're not making characters?
 
 __Speak to your players!__
 {: style="text-align: center;"}
 
Apply the _'onion rule'_ by only developing those plots your players want to explore. I usually use the ending of a session to ask what players liked and disliked about the game and what their character's internal thoughts are. And as the game progresses, note down what you see they enjoy. Note the ideas they give you and observations you make quickly during the session and transfer them to a more structured database (a spreadsheet suffices, but I suggest you look into [mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) if you don't use them already).

Remember, akin to a TV series or a book, not every episode/chapter of your campaign is going to contain the big-reveals, the tear jerking moments and the soul-tearing moral dilemmas. But even without those, every session should focus on the undisputed universal pleasure of tabletop RPGs, which is spending some quality time with your friends.
